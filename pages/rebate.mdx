## Rebate Calculations

_Note_: naive implementation, expect changes

bundleCost = mev bribe + bundleTxs[1,2,...]

gasAllowance = mev bribe - bundleTxs[1,2,...]

BundleTransactionGas[1,2,...] = Individual Gas Cost

BundleId = The Block Number (or hash?) in which the bundle was included

max_gasRebate = (BundleId(BundleTransactionGas[1,2,...]))

```json
{
  "confidence": 80,
  "price": 150,
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": 1.75,
  "maxFeePerGas": 100
}
```

## Rebate Mechanism

1. Eligible transactions are rebated based on the 80th confidence interval for
   gas estimation pricing.

2. This is porportionally distributed based on transactional weight. _Note: a
   naive formula would consider pairings, then slippage tolernance and finally
   transactional amount_

3. The amount of compensation is the remainder less fees to miners and network
   operational transactional costs.

4. Compensation payouts occur no later than a half hour
