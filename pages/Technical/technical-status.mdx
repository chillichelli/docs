|      11      |       FAILED       |                            The transaction was mined into a block, but the execution of its smart contract code failed\. Several reasons are possible, most notably "out of gas"\. The transaction is still included in a block because its gas is still awarded to the miner who attempted to execute it\.                            |
|      12      |      REJECTED      | The transaction was mined into a block but was rejected during the execution of its smart contract code\. Several reasons are possible, most notably Solidity's require\(\) assertions not being satisfied\. The transaction is still included in a block because it's gas is still awarded to the miner who attempted to execute it\. |

We have given up \(or the customer requested us not to retry\)\.                                                                                 |

This state is more or less equivalent to QUEUED, but its name is more telling\.                                                  |
