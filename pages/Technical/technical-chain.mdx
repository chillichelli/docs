### Chain Reorgs

We need to detect re-orgs. Each time re query for a block we should have a
reference for what we expect the parent hash to be. A re-org is dectected when
the retrieved block's parent hash does not match the expected parent hash. Next
we need to add some metadata to how the Exfiltrator sends data to the Loader.
Instead of passing raw blocks we should do something like this:

```python
class ChainSegment(NamedTuple):
    blocks: Tuple[Block, ...]
    is_reorg: bool = False

```

For the normal case, the exfiltrator would transmit

```python
ChainSegment(blocks=(next_block,), is_reorg=False).
```

In the case that a reorg has been encountered it would trace backwards up the
parent_hash links until it encounters a previously known block. The exfiltrator
would transmit ChainSegment(blocks=new_chain_segment, is_reorg=True). We can
bound re-org detection to a fixed maximum size window and error out if tracing
backwards up the chain exceeds this limit.
