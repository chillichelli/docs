## SushiSwap

The SushiSwap integration provides a service that realizes profit by transaction
batching for the purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool and
thus give away the arbitrage, front-running, back-running opportunities to
miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a crediabily netural platform that enables aggregation of
transactions (batching) for the purposes of extracting MEV profits and returning
them back to the traders.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

> "...that it is not just neutrality that is required here, it is credible
> neutrality. That is, it is not just enough for a mechanism to not be designed
> to favor specific people or outcomes over others; itâ€™s also crucially
> important for a mechanism to be able to convince a large and diverse group of
> people that the mechanism at least makes that basic effort to be fair."

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality
is having a clear and comprehensive rulebook that regulates off-chain behavior
and activities. Our assumption concerning governance is that methods and
processes that work in legacy markets may not be applicable in adversarial
environments such as permissionless blockchains. With that understanding it is
important not to rely soley on such systems and mechanics long term.
