## Motivation

This is a service that realizes profit by transaction batching
for the purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool
and thus give away the arbitrage, front-running, back-running
opportunities to miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a crediabily netural platform that enables 
aggregation of transactions (batching) for the purposes of extracting 
MEV profits and returning them back to the traders.


## What is MEV

*Maximal Exhaustive/Extracted Value*

MEV is that which can be extracted from a blockchain by any agent without special
permissions. Considering this permissionless nature, any agent with
transaction ordering rights will be in a privileged position to perform
the extraction. In Proof of Work blockchains, it is miners who determine
transaction ordering within a block, hence the usage of "_miner_"
term. In practice, bot operators seek to extract MEV by either paying
high fees to increase the likelihood that their transactions are mined,
or by fine-tuning their gas price choices in order to “time” their
transactions right. 

## General Considerations

Note, that 'MEV' is a theoretical quantity that can only be approached asymptotically. 
Unforseen extraction methods can and will be devised. For example, every new DeFi hack 
is a type of MEV extraction event. 

In systems such as Flashbots there’s two classes of actors in their system _Searchers_
and _Miners_. We use the generic label _Miner_ / _Block Producer_ for actors that bear the
role of transaction inclusion and ordering.

_Searchers_ are any non-privileged actors aiming to profit from these opportunities.
Miners can (and do) also act as searchers.
