## SushiSwap

The SushiSwap integration provides a service that realizes profit by transaction
batching for the purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool and
thus give away the arbitrage, front-running, back-running opportunities to
miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a crediabily netural platform that enables aggregation of
transactions (batching) for the purposes of extracting MEV profits and returning
them back to the traders.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality
is having a clear and comprehensive rulebook that regulates off-chain behavior
and activities. Our assumption concerning governance is that methods and processes
that work in legacy markets may not be applicable in adversarial environments such as
permissionless blockchains.

### What is MEV

_Maximal Exhaustive/Extracted Value_

MEV is that which can be extracted from a blockchain by any agent without
special permissions. Considering this permissionless nature, any agent with
transaction ordering rights will be in a privileged position to perform the
extraction. In Proof of Work blockchains, it is miners who determine transaction
ordering within a block, hence the usage of "_miner_" term. In practice, bot
operators seek to extract MEV by either paying high fees to increase the
likelihood that their transactions are mined, or by fine-tuning their gas price
choices in order to “time” their transactions right.

## General Considerations

Note, that 'MEV' is a theoretical quantity that can only be approached
asymptotically. Unforseen extraction methods can and will be devised. For
example, every new DeFi hack is a type of MEV extraction event.

In systems such as Flashbots there’s two classes of actors in their system
_Searchers_ and _Miners_. We use the generic label _Miner_ / _Block Producer_
for actors that bear the role of transaction inclusion and ordering.

_Searchers_ are any non-privileged actors aiming to profit from these
opportunities. Miners can (and do) also act as searchers.
