## Motivation

This is a strategy that realizes profit by transaction batching
for the purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool
and thus give away the arbitrage, front-running, back-running
opportunities to miners(or random bots).

YCabal creates a virtualized mempool (i.e. a MEV-relay network) that
aggregates transactions (batching), such transactions include:

Users can opt in and send transactions to YCabal and in return for not
having to pay for gas for their transaction we batch process it and take
the arbitrage profit from it. Risk by inventory price risk is carried by
a Vault, where Vault depositors are returned the profit the YCabal
realizes.

## Background

*Maximal Exhaustive Value*

MEV is that which can be extracted from a blockchain by any agent without special
permissions. Considering this permissionless nature, any agent with
transaction ordering rights will be in a privileged position to perform
the extraction. In Proof of Work blockchains, it is miners who determine
transaction ordering within a block, hence the usage of "_miner_"
term. In practice, bot operators seek to extract MEV by either paying
high fees to increase the likelihood that their transactions are mined,
or by fine-tuning their gas price choices in order to “time” their
transactions right, as is the case when backrunning an oracle update to
perform a liquidation.

## General Considerations

The first important point to make is that MEV is a theoretical
quantity that we can only approach asymptotically. Unforseen extraction
methods can and will be devised (every new DeFi hack is an MEV
extraction event).

We note that there’s two classes of actors in the system, _searchers_
and _miners_. We use the generic label _miner_ for actors that bear the
privileged role of transaction inclusion and ordering. _Searchers_ are
any non-privileged actors aiming to profit from these opportunities.
Crucially, miners can also act as searchers.
